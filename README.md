# CalculatePiInC
Just a little program based on the fact that the probability that two 
random numbers are coprime(meaning their Greatest Common Denominator is 
one) is 6/pi^2. 

This program just generates "ton" of random numbers, calculates the 
probability of the numbers being coprime and then uses it to calculate 
Pi by doing simple math ( myProbability = 6/pi^2 ---> pi = 
sqrt(6/myProbability) ). 

I am just noob. I've done it completly wrong. I don't know C. I know 
that i know nothing and i know that i need to improve. Knowing that is 
enough for me. 

Bye:)
